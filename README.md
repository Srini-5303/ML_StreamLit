This project is a full website built from scratch using Machine Learning and StreamLit.

It predicts the salary of a person based on the user's country, education and years of experience. 
This is done using a Linear Regression model.

The UI of the app is created using StreamLit, and is dynamic.

There is also an explore page, where the user can have a visual representation of the data in a pie chart, bar graph and a line graph.
